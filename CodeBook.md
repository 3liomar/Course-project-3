This data set, show a summary for the measurements of the variables used for "the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" project. This summary consist of the mean for 69 variables for each subject that have a participation in the experiment and for each activity that those subjects preforms. 

This variables can be grouped by the ID variables and the measurement variables.

1.- the ID variables consist in the next variables:

        -activitynames: this variables contains the names of the activities that every subject makes for all the test. This can be:
        
                1 WALKING
                2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
                3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
                4 SITTING
                5 STANDING
                6 LAYING
        
        -subject: corresponds to the ID number of the subject that was preforming the activity. This can be:
        
                a number from 1 to 30.
        
        -set: corresponds to the identification of the subgroup of subjects that makes the experiment. This can be:
        
                1 train: for the subject that belong to the subgroup of train
                1 test: for the subject that belong to the subgroup of test

2.- The measurement variables consist in the next variables, for each one of this, it shows the mean and the standard deviation for each subject and each activity.
